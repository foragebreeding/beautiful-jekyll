Welcome to Dr. Esteban Rios's **Forage Breeding and Genetics Lab** in the [Agronomy Department](https://agronomy.ifas.ufl.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} at the [University of Florida](www.ufl.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

Research in Dr. Riosâ€™s program is dedicated to using traditional and modern plant breeding techniques to develop improved varieties of forages in Florida. 

This integrated approach combines plant breeding, quantitative genetics, molecular biology, cytogentics, crop modeling, crop mapping, and genomics to accelerate genetic gain in forages including alfalfa, ryegrass, clovers, and cowpea.
